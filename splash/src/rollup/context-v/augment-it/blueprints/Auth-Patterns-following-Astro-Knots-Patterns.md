title: "Auth Patterns — Following Astro Knots Conventions in a Rsbuild + Module-Federation Shell"
lede: "Augment-it isn't a pure Astro site — the shell is Rsbuild + Svelte + Module Federation, and the backend is NATS-fronted microservices with a workspace-service holding session tokens. But the Astro Knots auth conventions (session cookie, middleware gate, public allowlist, never-prerender-a-gated-route) still encode the right discipline. This blueprint translates each rule into the augment-it architecture so the audit-trail and the failure modes stay legible across the two stacks."

# Auth Patterns — Following Astro Knots Conventions

<!-- developing — stub captured 2026-06-01. Topics this blueprint needs to
     name when its body is written:

     - WHAT EXISTS: services/workspace-service holds `sessions.json` (auth
       tokens, surfaced in scripts/backup-stores.sh as sensitive). The shell
       and remotes consume tokens via the workspace WebSocket.
     - WHAT TRANSLATES from Astro Knots: session-cookie discipline; the
       public allowlist concept (which surfaces are reachable pre-auth);
       the "no silent bypass" principle behind the Astro Knots rule about
       gated routes never being prerendered.
     - WHAT DOESN'T TRANSLATE LITERALLY: there's no Astro middleware
       because the shell is Rsbuild, not Astro. The equivalent gate is
       the workspace-service's token check on WS upgrade + per-capability
       authorization. Prerender-vs-SSR isn't a concern; the failure mode
       it prevents (CDN serving a gated route around the gate) doesn't
       apply.
     - THE SHARED FAILURE FAMILY: silent bypass in either stack means a
       gate that *looks* present but doesn't run on every request. In
       Astro Knots that's prerender=true under middleware; in augment-it
       it's any new capability handler that forgets the per-request auth
       check.
     - INITIAL-USER-EXPERIENCE TIE-IN: the auth gate is part of the first
       30 seconds — see [[../specs/Initial-User-Experience]].

     Body to develop with the user. Cross-reference the Astro Knots skill
     reference at calmstorm-decks middleware and dididecks-ai/changelog/
     2026-05-17_02.md (the auth-loop debugging trace) once developed. -->
