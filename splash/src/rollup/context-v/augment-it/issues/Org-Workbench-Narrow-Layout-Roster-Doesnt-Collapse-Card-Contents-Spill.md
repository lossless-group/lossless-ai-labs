title: "Org Workbench in a narrow pane — the roster doesn't collapse, and the org card's contents spill out of their container"
lede: "Tiled next to Search & Add, the workbench squeezes into a center column and misbehaves twice: the roster column eats width it can't afford (it should auto-hide below a threshold, with a manual toggle), and the org card's link rows and people rows overflow the card's right edge instead of shrinking — the flexbox min-width:auto trap."

# Narrow-pane workbench: roster hogs, card spills

## The two symptoms (screenshot-confirmed, 2026-07-24 evening)

1. **Roster doesn't yield.** The coverage roster keeps its 300px in a pane
   that can't afford it. Wanted: auto-hide below a width threshold, plus an
   always-available show/hide toggle so the operator can override either way.
2. **The card doesn't contain its contents.** Long link URLs
   (theorg.com/org/…) and people rows run past the org card's right border
   at whatever width they like. Cause: `.ow-url` has ellipsis styling but is
   a flex item with implicit `min-width: auto`, so it never shrinks — the
   row grows instead, and the same rule bites the `.ow-lists` grid items
   and the person-row spans.

## The fix (this doc precedes the implementation by minutes)

- `min-width: 0` at every level that must shrink: the card, the lists-grid
  items, the entry rows, `.ow-url` (with `flex: 1 1 auto` so ellipsis
  actually engages), and the person-row name/role spans (ellipsis).
- App-level: measure the columns wrapper (`bind:clientWidth`); roster
  auto-hides under ~860px; a compact toggle beside the search row shows
  "◀/▶ orgs" and overrides the auto behavior in either direction.
- This narrows the gap the component-library issue
  ([[No-Component-Library-UI-Improvised-Not-Component-Based]]) will close
  properly — containment rules belong in shared list components, not
  re-discovered per remote.
