title: "Initial User Experience — From Landing to a Productive First Action"
lede: "What does the first thirty seconds of augment-it feel like? This spec covers the surface a brand-new user lands on, the lightweight onboarding that gets them to a productive first action without lecturing, and the seams where the working-app and architecture-demonstration identities first meet the visitor. Designed to be skipped by returning users, never re-shown unnecessarily, and never required to dismiss to do work."

# Initial User Experience

<!-- developing — stub captured 2026-06-01. The shape this should cover:
       - what loads at http://localhost:3100 (or the deployed equivalent)
         for a user with no session and no record sets;
       - the minimal onboarding (skippable, never blocking, never re-shown
         once skipped) that points at the Flow widget and the first step;
       - the seam where the dual identity surfaces (do we offer the
         "see the architecture" reveal up front, or only via the per-remote
         API-docs CTA from [[API-First-In-App-Documentation]]?);
       - the auth gate's first impression (informed by
         [[../blueprints/Auth-Patterns-following-Astro-Knots-Patterns]]).
     Body to develop with the user. -->
