title: "API-First In-App Documentation — Each Surface Reveals Its Own Docs Inline"
lede: "Every remote, the shell, and every service ships its documentation inside itself — toggled by a small icon-CTA, revealed inline within the surface rather than in a separate tab. Not generic API docs but relevant ones: the data flowing in, the services called with which payloads, the response shapes, the diagrams. Because augment-it is also a demonstration of API-first architecture, the docs are part of the product, not adjacent to it."

# API-First In-App Documentation

<!-- developing — stub captured 2026-06-01 from the Shell-and-Micro-Frontend-
     UX-Coherence spec's Wish-list section. Motivated by the architecture-
     demonstration identity (see [[../blueprints/Augment-It-as-Working-App-
     and-Architecture-Demo]]). Body to develop with the user. -->
